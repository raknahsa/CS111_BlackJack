Changes in code for more advanced play

For double down:
After count is 2, there will be an option which will allow the user to double down.
If they user says yes, then the bet will be doubled and only 1 more card will be dealt(possibly go out of loop)
Whether they win/lose is the same code.

For insurance:
If the face up card is an ace, there will be a loop which asks each player if they want to take insurance.
There will also be a separate variable for the insurance bet which will be be added/reduced to the balance if they win/lose.

For split:
Have a temporary variable to check if the last card is the same so that a split can be offered, if the player decides to split, have a if statement
that allows for two hands to exists and only runs if the player has decided to split.
Also use the count variable to check which round it is to see if split is possible.

For blackjack:
Have a separate if statement that check if the player got black jack and then have more money be given if this occurs(probably 1.5x more)\

For hints:
Using the probability statistics and data from online, hints will be given on how favorable it is to hit/split/stand and etc.
Hints will either give the probability of winning for the respective move or have it so if the probability of a
move to win is greater than 50%(could be changed), the hint system will tell that it is favorable.

Examples of probability/hint
Hint: Your score is 20, you should stand as you have a high chance of busting.
Hint: You got 2 aces, it is favorable for you to split.

hint system can also possibly count cards to change probability as the game goes on.
shuffling at each round may have to be removed for this to work.
